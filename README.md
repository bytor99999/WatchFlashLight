# WatchFlashLight
Apple Watch iOS app for making a flash light app on your Apple Watch.

Includes a Complication to allow quick easy access to the flash light.

All you need to do is 

##1) Clone the repo to your local computer.

##2) Open up the project in XCode.

##3) Select the project to get to the "General" configuration section. select your Team profile.
(This step might not be necessary.)

##4) Make sure "WatchLightFlash WatchKit App" is selected as your scheme. and your iPhone/Watch is connectected and selected in the drop down next to the scheme drop down

##5) Build and run on the watch.


After the app has been installed on your Apple Watch, you can edit your watch face and select a complication area and scroll through till you see the Flashlight. 

Does not support Modular Large complication, as why would you want the flash light complication to take such a large area when things like calendar events are better use of that type of complication area.

This is free to use anywhere. Apple is not accepting any Flash Light apps to the App Store for the Apple Watch, and therefore I decided to make it available free to anyone who wants to go through the process of downloading and installing on your Watch via XCode.
